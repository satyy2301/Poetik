of that day","That the village of Louisburg was thrown into a wild state or dismay,","","And the villagers flew to the beach in a state of wild uproar","And in a dory they found four men were cast ashore.","Then the villagers, in surprise assembled about the dory,","And they found that the bottom of the boat was gory;","Then their hearts were seized with sudden dread,","when they discovered that two of the men were dead.","","And the two survivors were exhausted from exposure, hunger, and cold,","Which used the spectators to shudder when them they did behold;","And with hunger the poor men couldn't stand on their feet,","They felt so weakly on their legs for want of meat.","","They were carried to a boarding-house without delay,","But those that were looking on were stricken with dismay,","When the remains of James and Angus McDonald were found in the boat,","Likewise three pieces or flesh in a pool or blood afloat.","","Angus McDonald's right arm was missing from the elbow,","and the throat was cut in a sickening manner which filled the villagers hearts with woe,","Especially when they saw two pieces of flesh had been cut from each thigh,","'Twas then the

pangs of hunger are very hard to thole,","And anything that's eatable is precious unto an hungry soul.","","Alas it is most pitiful and horrible to think","That with hunger christians will each

passed through the Civil War,","Declared the scene surpassed anything he's seen by far,","And at the sight, the crowd in horror turned away,","which no doubt they will remember for many a

gay;","And we arrived on the Western banks on the succeeding Tuesday,","While the time unto us seemed to pass merrily away.","","About eight O'clock in the morning, we left the vessel in a dory,","And I hope all kind christians will take heed to my story;","Well, while we were at our work, the sky began to frown,","And with a dense fog we were suddenly shut down","","Then we hunted and shouted, and every nerve did strain,","Thinking to find our schooner but, alas! it was all in vain:","Because the thick fog hid the vessel from our view,","And to keep ourselves warm we closely to each other drew.","","We had not one drop of water , nor provisions of any kind,","Which, alas soon began to tell on our mind;","Especially upon James McDonald who was very thinly clad,","And with the cold and hunger he felt almost mad.","","And looking from the stern where he was lying,","he said Good bye, mates, Oh! I am dying!","Poor fellow we kept his body thinking the rest of us would be saved,","Then, with hunger, Angus McDonald began to cry and madly raved.","","And he cried, Oh, God! send us some kind of meat,","Because I'm resolved to have something to eat;","Oh!

go,","Walking cautiously along o'er the crisp and crackling snow,","And the path was a narrow one, the greater part of the way","Through a dark forest, which filled his heart with dismay.","","And when hurrying onward, not to be late at the festival,","He heard the howl of a wolf, which did his heart appal,","And the howl was answered, and as the howl came near","Poor Old Dick, fiddle in hand,

terrible rapidity,","So that Dick didn't know whether to stand or flee.","","And his only chance, he thought, was to keep them at bay","By preserving the greatest steadiness without dismay,","Until he was out of the forest and on open ground,","Where he thought a place of safety might be found.","","He remembered an old hut stood in the clearing,","And towards it he was slowly nearing,","And the hope of reaching it urged him on,","But he felt a trifle dispirited and woe-begone.","","And the poor fellow's heart with fear gave a bound,","When he saw the wolves' green eyes glaring all around,","And they rushed at him boldly, one after another,","Snapping as they passed, which to him was great bother.","","And Dick sounded his fiddle and tried to turn them back,","And the sound caused the wolves to leap back in a crack,","When Dick took to his heels at full run,","But now poor Dick's danger was only begun:","","For the wolves pursued him without delay,","But Dick arrived at the hut in great dismay,","And had just time to get on the roof and play,","And at the strains of the music the wolves felt gay.","","And for several hours he sat there in pain,","Knowing if he stopped playing the wolves would be at him again,","But the rage of the wolves abated to the subduing strains,","And at last he was rewarded for all his pains:","","For the wedding-party began to

him, as he thought most fit,","That the Parliament dreading an attempt might be made to rescue him,","The soldiers were called out to arms, and that had made the din.","","Do I, said Montrose, continue such a terror still?","Now when these good men are about my blood to spill,","But let them look to themselves, for after I am dead,","Their wicked consciences will be in continual dread.","","After partaking of a hearty breakfast, he commenced his toilet,","Which, in his greatest trouble, he seldom did forget.","And while in the act of combing his hair,","He was visited by the

it at my ease,","And to-morrow, when it becomes yours, treat it as you please.","","He was waited upon by the Magistrates of the city,","But, alas! for him they had no pity.","He was habited in a

the executioner to make haste and get quickly through,","But the executioner smiled grimly, but spoke not a word,","Then he tied the Book of Montrose's Wars round his neck with a cord.","","Then he told the executioner his foes would remember him hereafter,","And he was as well pleased as if his Majesty had made him Knight of the Garter;","Then he asked to be allowed to cover his head,","But he was denied permission, yet he felt no dread.","","He then asked leave to keep on his cloak,","But was also denied, which was a most grievous stroke;","Then he told the Magistrates, if they could invent any more tortures for him,","He would endure them all for the cause he suffered, and think it no sin.","","On arriving at the top of the ladder with great firmness,","His heroic appearance greatly did the bystanders impress,","Then Montrose asked the executioner how long his body would be suspended,","Three hours was the answer, but Montrose was not the least offended.","","Then he presented the executioner with three or four pieces of gold,","Whom he freely forgave, to his honour be it told,","And told him to throw him off as soon as he uplifted his hands,","While the

down,","And in the midst of the dying, he never once did frown;","Nor he didn't shake with fear, nor yet did he mourne,","But patiently sat down to wait his own turn.","","And when the Surgeon saw him, he instantly ran,","But Nelson said, Surgeon, attend to that man;","Attend to the sailor you were at, for he requires your aid,","Then I will take my turn, don't be the least afraid.","","And

pondered, weak and weary,","Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--","While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,","As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.","\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--","        Only this and nothing more.\"","","Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,","And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.","Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow","From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--","For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--","        Nameless here for evermore.","","And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain","Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;","So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating","\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--","Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--","    This it is and nothing more.\"","","Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,","\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;","But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,","And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,","That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--","      Darkness there and nothing more.","","Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,","  fearing,","Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;","But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,","And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"","This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"","      Merely this and nothing more.","","Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,","Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.","\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;","Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--","Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--","    'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"","","Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,","In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;","Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;","But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--","Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--","    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.","","Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,","By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,","\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no","  craven,","Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--","Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"","      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"","","Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,","Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;","For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being","Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--","Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,","      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"","","But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only","That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.","Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--","Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--","On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"","      Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"","","Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,","\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,","Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster","Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--","Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore","    Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"","","But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,","Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and","  door;","Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking","Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--","What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore","    Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"","","This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing","To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;","This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining","On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,","But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,","      _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!","","Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer","Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.","\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath","  sent thee","Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!","Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"","      Quoth the Raven,

desert land enchanted--","On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--","Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"","    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"","","\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!","By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--","Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,","It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--","Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"","      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"","","\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,","  upstarting--","\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!","Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!","Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!","Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"","    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"","","And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting","On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;","And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that

unclosed;","So wills its King, who hath forbid","The uplifting of the fringed lid;","And thus the sad Soul that here passes","Beholds it but through darkened glasses.","","By a route obscure and lonely,","Haunted by ill angels only.","","Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,","On a black throne reigns upright,","I have wandered home but newly","From this ultimate dim Thule."],"linecount":"56"},{"title":"To The River","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow","  Of crystal, wandering water,","Thou art an emblem of the glow","      Of beauty--the unhidden heart--","      The playful maziness of art","  In old Alberto's daughter;","","But when within thy wave she looks--","  Which glistens then, and trembles--","Why, then, the prettiest of brooks","  Her worshipper resembles;","For in his heart, as in thy stream,","  Her image deeply lies--","His heart which trembles at the beam","  Of her soul-searching eyes."],"linecount":"14"},{"title":"Song","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["I saw thee on thy bridal day--","  When a burning blush came o'er thee,","Though happiness around thee lay,","  The world all love before thee:","","And in thine eye a kindling light","  (Whatever it might be)","Was all on Earth my aching sight","  Of Loveliness could see.","","That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--","  As such it well may pass--","Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame","  In the breast of him, alas!","","Who saw thee on that bridal day,","  When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,","Though happiness around thee lay,","  The world all love before thee."],"linecount":"16"},{"title":"Fairyland","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["Dim vales--and shadowy floods--","And cloudy-looking woods,","Whose forms we can't discover","For the tears that drip all over","Huge moons there wax and wane--","Again--again--again--","Every moment of the night--","Forever changing places--","And they put out the star-light","With the breath from their pale faces.","About twelve by the moon-dial","One more filmy than the rest","(A kind which, upon trial,","They have found to be the best)","Comes down--still down--and down","With its centre on the crown","Of a mountain's eminence,","While its wide circumference","In easy drapery falls","Over hamlets, over halls,","Wherever they may be--","O'er the strange woods--o'er the sea--","Over spirits on the wing--","Over every drowsy thing--","And buries them up quite","In a labyrinth of light--","And then, how deep!--O, deep!","Is the passion of their sleep.","In the morning they arise,","And their moony covering","Is soaring in the skies,","With the tempests as they toss,","Like--almost any thing--","Or a yellow Albatross.","They use that moon no more","For the same end as before--","Videlicet a tent--","Which I think extravagant:","Its atomies, however,","Into a shower dissever,","Of which those butterflies,","Of Earth, who seek the skies,","And so come down again","(Never-contented thing!)","Have brought a specimen","Upon their quivering wings."],"linecount":"46"},{"title":"The Lake","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["In spring of youth it was my lot","To haunt of the wide world a spot","The which I could not love the less--","So lovely was the loneliness","Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,","And the tall pines that towered around.","","But when the Night had thrown her pall","Upon the spot, as upon all,","And the mystic wind went by","Murmuring in melody--","Then--ah, then, I would awake","To the terror of the lone lake.","","Yet that terror was not fright,","But a tremulous delight--","A feeling not the jewelled mine","Could teach or bribe me to define--","Nor Love--although the Love were thine.","","Death was in that poisonous wave,","And in its gulf a fitting grave","For him who thence could solace bring","To his lone imagining--","Whose solitary soul could make","An Eden of that dim lake."],"linecount":"23"},{"title":"Evening Star","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["'Twas noontide of summer,","  And midtime of night,","And stars, in their orbits,","  Shone pale, through the light","Of the brighter, cold moon.","  'Mid planets her slaves,","Herself in the Heavens,","  Her beam on the waves.","","  I gazed awhile","  On her cold smile;","Too cold--too cold for me--","  There passed, as a shroud,","  A fleecy cloud,","And I turned away to thee,","  Proud Evening Star,","  In thy glory afar","And dearer thy beam shall be;","  For joy to my heart","  Is the proud part","Thou bearest in Heaven at night,","  And more I admire","  Thy distant fire,","Than that colder, lowly light."],"linecount":"23"},{"title":"Imitation","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["A dark unfathomed tide","Of interminable pride--","A mystery, and a dream,","Should my early life seem;","I say that dream was fraught","With a wild and waking thought","Of beings that have been,","Which my spirit hath not seen,","Had I let them pass me by,","With a dreaming eye!","Let none of earth inherit","That vision on my spirit;","Those thoughts I would control,","As a spell upon his soul:","For that bright hope at last","And that light time have past,","And my wordly rest hath gone","With a sigh as it passed on:","I care not though it perish","With a thought I then did cherish."],"linecount":"20"},{"title":"Hymn To Aristogeiton And Harmodius","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","lines":["Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,","  Like those champions devoted and brave,","When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,","  And to Athens deliverance gave.","","Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam","  In the joy breathing isles of the blest;","Where the mighty of old have their home--","  Where Achilles and Diomed rest.","","In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,","  Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,","When he made at the tutelar shrine","  A libation of Tyranny's blood.","","Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!","  Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!","Endless ages shall cherish your fame,","  Embalmed in their echoing songs!"],"linecount":"16"}]
